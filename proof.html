Without a plan.

I sensed a tap on my shoulder, and my coins scattered everywhere. With a curse, I leaned down to collect them, a girl coming into my view not a second later. 

I scoured her face, my eyebrows furrowing the more she smiled at me. She looked to be around the same age as me. Her smile was warm, her complexion showing more freckles than skin, and her fiery red hair reflected the sun.

She asked if I was all right and if I needed help. I could not remember the last time someone had offered their help. I did need help, (click-append: &quot;I did need help,&quot;) [ But asking for it was never my strongest forte.]

I couldn’t form words at the start, but it did not unnerve the girl. (click-append: &quot;it did not unnerve the girl,&quot;) [ considering how she became in the later years.] She reached for my left hand and helped me stand up, then she unclenched my hand and placed a few loose changes in my palm.

//Call whomever you want to call//, she said.] 

I hesitated ringing my mother, not knowing whether my father was hovering over the phone and would not let her answer or not. I decided to wait, and pocketed the change the girl gave me, thinking I could have use for it later. She saw the coins slip inside my pocket, but her smile never wavered. 

She asked me if I wanted to go inside the coffee shop across the street. (click-append:&quot;She asked me if I wanted to go inside the coffee shop across the street.&quot;) [

Walked in a boy, about six feet from what I could see. Dark haired, square jaw, and tanned smooth skin with the occasional mole. He was very handsome, with expressive eyes and a smile that took up the entire room. The boy wore one of those thick brown wool sweaters one might see on a tennis court at Wimbledon, layered over a cream button down and dark slacks.

He was walking smoothly through the throngs of family, friends, and little kids, stopping to greet a few men with a firm handshake, and moving on to approach the group of ladies standing close to where I was. He bowed his head in greeting, flashing them a charming smile.] (click-append:&quot;flashing them a charming smile.&quot;) [

The demurest.] (click-append:&quot;The demurest.&quot;) [

And in that moment, we made eye contact. He excused the ladies and made his way to me, stopping in front of me. From close range, I could count how many moles were on his face. //Five.//] (click-append:&quot;Five.&quot;) [

//Nonsense!// He grinned. //They said no such thing. And I don&#39;t believe whoever said you&#39;re unpleasant. I think you&#39;re a delight.//

This is what I knew about Arlene Levard: she grew up with a devoted mother and a loving father. Her father passed away ~~I wish that was my situation~~ when she was fourteen. Her mother, who was deep in financial stress, married Daniel Chapman, the head of Police department in New York. He had a son, Arthur. (click-replace: &quot;Arthur.&quot;) [ I believe that is when Arlene&#39;s paranoia began.]

She was a sweet girl, the smile never leaving her face. She would shake a stranger&#39;s hand on the street, help older people cross the road. 

The more time I spent with her, //especially// at the Chapman-Levard house, I noticed how unlike herself she was there. (click-append: &quot;I noticed how unlike herself she was there.&quot;) [ She slept with one eye open, her bedroom door locked at all times. Vigilant. Looking over her shoulder.

In that house, she was the opposite of the girl I knew outside of it. (click-append: &quot;she was the opposite of the girl I knew outside of it.&quot;) [ It could have been Arthur&#39;s influence, ~~or mine~~...no definitely Arthur&#39;s.]

I tried to be there for her as much as I could, but she pushed me away at times. So, I left it alone.

A person changing another&#39;s life trajectory.

//[[Enigma]]//</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Genevieve" tags="background13" position="225,900" size="100,100">It was a beautiful morning in the Chapman-Levard house. The sun dipped just right. The perfect temperature.

Arlene and I were laying down on chaise longues, a frosted glass of Tom Collins was cradled in my hands, my fingers slick with condensation. A wide brimmed yellow straw hat was rested on my head, shielding my eyes from the sun.

I was in the middle of rehashing a story to Arlene when I heard her give out a shriek,  (click-append: &quot;give out a shriek,&quot;) [ the shrilling sound piercing my ears.] With a huff, I took off my hat, placing it on the ground and sat up to see Arlene clutching a girl in a tight hug, swaying back and forth on the spot. They released each other, and the girl turned to look at me. 

She had light hair that caught in the sun whichever way she titled her head, creating a glowing sheen. Her eyes were the colour of deep pools of water. She walked toward me, her stride light. I slid my legs to touch the ground the same moment she thrusted her hand in my direction. (click-append:&quot;she thrusted her hand in my direction.&quot;) [

//Hello,// she said. //I&#39;m Miss Genevieve Everett. It is lovely to meet you.//]

I placed my palm in hers, one shake up and down. They were soft and porcelain like in my grasp, and I thought to myself (click-append: &quot;I thought to myself&quot;) [ those are the hands of a pianist.]

Later when it was just myself and Arlene tucked in the same bed in the night that I learned Arlene and Genevieve used to take piano lessons in the afternoon after school hours. Genevieve Everett had a boringly normal family dynamic. Her father died of a rare disease when she was three years old, and her mother never remarried. 

I have always wondered what it was like to live without a father. (click-append: &quot;live without a father.&quot;) [ She was lucky in that sense.]

Over cups of tea on an early July morning at a local coffee shop she loves, she gave me a smile that rivalled the sun and held my ever-cold hands in her own warm ones. (click-append:&quot;warm ones.&quot;) [

Always a pair, came and left as a pair. They grew up on the same street, in houses with the large picket white fences, weekly cookouts, and golden retrievers running around, the life I wanted to have.

Edward had a small family. Just him, his parents, and a younger sister. He spent most of his days at Julian&#39;s house.

Julian&#39;s family in comparison, was large. He had many siblings and even more cousins that were present at all time. The day we met at his house, I had one sibling cling onto my leg, while a cousin tugged on my hair. It didn&#39;t matter to them that I was a stranger standing inside their house. ~~It made me want to crawl out of my skin.~~ 

Luckily however, at that one specific gathering, I happened to meet a [[Thomas Keating]].]

It did not take much convincing for me to say yes. Arlene was generous enough to offer me one of the many spare bedrooms her house held.

The house was lavish and historic, nestled in the Hudson Valley. It was white stone with beautiful vines growing and cascading along its firm walls.

This place, even with how cold and quiet it  is, it is slowly becoming my home (click-rerun: &quot;becoming my home,&quot;) [ the only home I have really ever known.] Though, I have come to love its quietness.

One morning during breakfast time, it was just me and Arlene at the dining table. Her mother was having tea with her friends, Daniel was at work, and Arthur had just left the room. 

//What is the matter with you two?// (click-append:&quot;What is the matter with you two?&quot;) [I asked Arlene, sipping from my teacup and wincing once the hot Orange Pekoe made contact with my tongue.] (click-append:&quot;tongue&quot;) [

Arlene knowing what happened was a huge risk I wasn&#39;t willing to take, neither was Arthur from how it looked. We were at a good point in our career, and I wasn&#39;t about to lose it all.  

I looked at Arthur, only one solution coming to mind to make sure she&#39;d stay quiet, and what he found in my gaze had him grinning, but not the soft welcoming grin that would put you at ease, it was the kind of cold calculating grin, the slow curve of his lips that only shows when he&#39;s about to turn over a winning card.]]

Arlene never came out of that dressing room, never went past the secret door of the speakeasy.

Genevieve was the one to find her.

She went looking for us because we had taken too long.

Arthur walked inside, and knelt beside me, looking down at his unmoving step-sister. 

We shared a brief glance. He checked for a pulse, but he didn’t have to. 

Kneeling beside your bleeding body, clutching your hand that was painted with my tear drops.

Arthur unbuttoned his suit jacket and draped it around my shoulders. I pulled it tight against my body.

And hoped no one else saw the blood spatter on my dress.

Arthur possessed this certain gait that told a person he knew himself from the core outwards. It drew me in, and I found myself joining him at the dinning table for breakfast every morning.

I counted in my head how many seconds it took for him to speak again. I could feel his chest expand with every breath I took, and then he squeezed my hand. //Twice.//] (click-append:&quot;Twice.&quot;) [

The velvet curtained stage had just cleared from another unoriginal Charleston performance, the sixth of the night, and I could tell how utterly bored the audience looked. 

The audience, a jaded mix of bootleggers, jazz performers, journalists, and many of Arthur&#39;s friends I had seen around the Chapman-Levard house before. The crowd murmured and stirred in their seats. A yawn escaped a mouth, and a scraped back chair fell on its side from a man who got up to exit the speakeasy. 

This must have been why Arthur knew Henry McCartney was the right person to introduce me to. This speakeasy was in need of a refresh.

Thomas took his place at the edge of the dimmed stage, trumpet in hand. Julian was standing near him, tuning his bass with a focused pout to his lips. Edward was seated at the middle of the stage with his drum set, muttering a prayer to himself.

Arlene came up behind me and held on to my shoulders, wrapping me in a hug. (click-append:&quot;wrapping me in a hug.&quot;) [ //Are you ready to do this?// she whispered. //This is all you have been dreaming of.//] (click-append:&quot;Are you ready to do this? she whispered.

I let out a breath and nodded. This was //it//. This was the night where I would prove to myself that I was capable, that I am not my parents&#39; daughter, and I //would// make a name for myself.

Everyone took their places, then the lights darkened. A single [[spotlight]] snapped on, illuminating the red velvet curtain.]

All I have ever wanted was for us to succeed. I wanted us to be the highlight of every conversation. I wanted the speakeasy to be full to the brim of people who were there just to see us perform.

And keeping the speakeasy hidden, and occasionally pointing fingers at competition and whispering in officials&#39; ears was the only way we were going to reach that. No one can hardly blame me, right?

A problem arouse in the name of James Russo, a prohibition agent who was tasked with the aggravating mission of raiding //my// speakeasy from the inside out. He posed as a charming regular at first; laughing with Henry, taking dancers by the hand and twirling them around the dance floor. He drank the alcohol he was so adamant on banning. 

Arthur slowly befriended James once he noticed just how often he was loitering around. Arthur even saw him one night leave with a liquor bottle and paper records he didn&#39;t have when he first entered that night. 

James was clever, I&#39;ll give him that, but he wasn&#39;t clever enough. People often think they can go up against Arthur&#39;s charm and walk away unscathed. 

Arthur introduced me to James, and soon after, Arthur, James and I would sit around tables with candles flickering in glass holders, clinking flutes of champagne and laughing as if we were old friends.

We fabricated a lie about how we wanted to close this specific speakeasy since the owner was mistreating us and was not paying us what we deserved.

It makes me laugh how easy it was for James to trust and believe us. How can someone like him ever be an undercover? It was absurd, but it worked in our favour.

A good while after Arthur was completely sure James wasn&#39;t stopping at nothing to bring us down, Arthur asked James to meet us at an alleyway, far from the secret door that led down to the speakeasy to finalise our plan of &#39;raiding it&#39; with his Official friends.

Arthur did not hesitate to drive that knife in James&#39; gut, and I stood watching, guilt gnawing at my stomach, but I did nothing to stop him.

I&#39;m aware with how I am always praising Arthur&#39;s wits, and to a certain point I have believed he can protect me, but Arthur also believes himself Icarus. Anything and everything will go his way. Though, I don&#39;t think he could have predicted Arlene falling in love with James.

I noticed after our performances, James would be clapping the loudest, eyes trained on Arlene, and Arlene only. He would seek her out after she leaves the stage, buying her drinks, flowers, elaborate gifts. To be completely honest, I relied on the fact that Arlene would realise it was all a ruse, that she was just a way for James to really be //in// with everyone. To get information on //my// troupe

I couldn&#39;t see that happening in front of my eyes and do nothing, could I?

I shouldn&#39;t have been as surprised as I was to know Arlene found out what ~~we~~ Arthur did. She was oblivious most times, but I hate to admit it to myself, I might have underestimated her will to stand for what is right and what is wrong.

She was there when it happened. We didn&#39;t see her, but she saw //us//.&quot;)

My final move was a daring lift, standing on Thomas&#39; shoulders, who had abandoned his trumpet. I balanced on one heel, blew a kiss to McCartney, and flipped backwards, landing on the floor in a split as the lights dropped. 

A beat of silence, then the crowd erupted. (click-append:&quot;then the crowd erupted.&quot;) [

  &lt;em&gt;New Act Shaking The Roof!&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;hr&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Flapper &#39;Estelle Forrest&#39; Shocks Midnight Crowd at The Crimson Keys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  By Edith LeFevre, Society Desk&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW YORK CITY —&lt;/strong&gt; Jazz may swing, but last night it &lt;em&gt;shattered&lt;/em&gt;. At precisely 12:17 a.m., the new face of jazz &lt;strong&gt;Estelle Forrest&lt;/strong&gt; stunned the packed room at The Crimson Keys with an act that is already being whispered across the boroughs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The number began with a low and sultry riff, slow clarinet, a sensual trumpet, but halfway through her performance, Estelle &lt;strong&gt;uncorked a flask from her garter&lt;/strong&gt;, raised it in salute to the crowd, and toasted &lt;em&gt;&#39;To the dry fools in blue!&#39;&lt;/em&gt; before taking a bold swig onstage.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But the climax came moments later, as she walked into the crowd, toward a dapper man, clutched him by the lapels, and planted her lips against his in a passionate kiss. The man was revealed to be Arthur Chapman. We could not get a confirmation on what his relations are to Forrest&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Gasps, screams, and laughter followed as the room erupted. A commotion broke out near the back, where an &lt;strong&gt;undercover Prohibition agent reportedly fainted&lt;/strong&gt;. No arrests were made, but several cameras flashed just before Forrest disappeared in a swirl of sequins and shadow.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Club owner Henry McCartney seemed to be elated, as his speakeasy was finally being recognised. An insiders claim &lt;strong&gt;the club’s phones haven’t stopped ringing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Is she a criminal? A poet? A reckless dame with nothing to lose?&lt;br&gt;
  One thing is certain: &lt;em&gt;&#39;Estelle Forrest&#39; is a name the city won’t forget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot;&gt;— E.L.F.&lt;/p&gt;
